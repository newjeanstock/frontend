# Zukeeper

Zukeeper is a set of devtools for Zustand, in Zustand, featuring action and state logging, diffing, state hierarchy visualization, and time travel debugging. It's meant for the Zustand community, so it's fully open source and in active development ([flag issues](https://github.com/oslabs-beta/Zukeeper/issues), send us PRs!)

## How do I use it?

Zukeeper was designed with simplicity in mind, and the setup reflects that. Here's how you can start:

Install the [Zukeeper chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zukeeper-zustand-devtools/copnnlbbmgdflldkbnemmccblmgcnlmo?hl=en)

npm install zukeeper

```javascript
npm i zukeeper
```
Import zukeeper into your store creation file
Pass zukeeper as middleware to create( )
Assign your store, as you named it, to window.store

That's it! Once your extension is installed and your store is ready, you're good to go. Zukeeper lives in the Chrome devtool panel, just as you'd expect. Open them up, and begin using the tools! We look forward to expanding to additional browsers in upcoming releases.
